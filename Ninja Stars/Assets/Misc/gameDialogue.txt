[NAME=Punching Dummy of Wisdom] Welcome to the once-beautiful city of Kataro...
[NAME=You] Once-beautiful?
[NAME=Punching Dummy of Wisdom] Yes... After years of peace, a powerful ninja master, the Night Dragon, grew power-hungry and began growing an army...
[NAME=Punching Dummy of Wisdom] They are called the Raiders of the Night Dragon. They have taken the people's land and money...
[NAME=Punching Dummy of Wisdom] Those who do not comply are captured and held prisoner, while others have fled the city.
[NAME=You] I was sent here by the Elder Master, himself, to help the people of this land.
[NAME=Punching Dummy of Wisdom] You must be the young ninja we've heard about, let me show you the ropes!
[NAME=Punching Dummy of Wisdom] Use WASD to move, the Space Bar to jump, and "r" to attack!
[NAME=Punching Dummy of Wisdom] Collect the coins of the people scattered around the city, we will place it in our reserve.
[NAME=Punching Dummy of Wisdom] AVOID the shurikens that have been imbued with the Night Dragon's magic...
[NAME=Punching Dummy of Wisdom] ...and watch out for spikes used to keep out intruders.
[NAME=Punching Dummy of Wisdom] Lastly, take out any Raiders that are patrolling.
[NAME=Punching Dummy of Wisdom] Now GO! I will be around to help!
